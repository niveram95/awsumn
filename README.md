## Reccommended Code Editors
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Atom](https://atom.io/)

## Requirements
In order to install dependencies and run the program locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).  You might need to restart your computer to complete the installation.  Once you have Node installed, navigate into the directory your local repository is in and do the commands:

`npm install` to install dependencies.

`npm start` to start the program locally.

The app will should be running locally at `http://localhost:4200/`.
Use `ctrl + c` to stop running.

## Editing Code
All of the code you probably want to change is located in the `src` folder.
